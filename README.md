# Yuki Booking App

This project is a SwiftUI demo using Firebase Authentication and Realtime Database.

## Simulator warnings

While running on the iOS simulator you may see logs such as:

```
load_eligibility_plist: Failed to open ... eligibility.plist: No such file or directory
```

This comes from the simulator's Touch ID / Face ID subsystem and does not affect the app. Clearing derived data or resetting the simulator will remove the warning.
